      <description>&lt;p&gt;Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts.

It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Music from my time in Cape Town, Ahmedabad, and Sao Paulo My study abroad program in the fall of my Junior year focused on global cities in the 21st century. We usually worked and studied at a local university or community center and had to commute to and from our home stays every morning. I made a playlist for each of the three cities we stayed in - Sao Paulo, Cape Town, and Ahmedabad.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
