      <description>Music from my time in Cape Town, Ahmedabad, and Sao Paulo My study abroad program in the fall of my Junior year focused on global cities in the 21st century. We usually worked and studied at a local university or community center and had to commute to and from our home stays every morning. I made a playlist for each of the three cities we stayed in - Sao Paulo, Cape Town, and Ahmedabad.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a quantitative lead in a large-scale study of the causes and implications of disproportionate evictions in North Minneapolis using tax records, rental license data, and 100 landlord and tenant interviews.
This amazing team, led by Dr. Brittany Lewis at the Center for Urban and Regional Affairs, has worked with a youth participatory action research team, testified at state legislative hearings, advised on a Minnesota state Supreme Court eviction case, and frequently presents research updates to an Evictions Advisory Council.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
